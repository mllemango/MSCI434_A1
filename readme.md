## MSCI 434 Assignment 2

###Question 1 (100points)

You are responsible for designing a supply chain network (location-allocation). You have a set of plants manufacturing product A (single item), which needs to be distributed to a set of candidate warehouses(not all warehouses will be open). Each of the facilities has a fixed cost to operate and a fixed capacity. The transportation has a cost per unit transported, and since transportation is performed by a 3PL, there is an unlimited capacity.There a set of retail locations that must have their demand met. Distances between facilities and/or retailers may be found using Euclidean distance. The goal is to minimize total cost.


####a)Formulate the mathematical model to determine the optimal warehouse locations and product distribution in this supply chain and solve.  Discuss the solutions and any insight the results provide.

####b)Building off part (a), restrict each customer zone to be serviced by exactly one warehouse. How does this change the total cost and distribution network?

####c)Building off part (b), incorporate a carbon cap of 2500tonnes CO2e in your model using the following information. How does this change the total cost and distribution network?What are the upper and lower limits of the cap to see notable impa
